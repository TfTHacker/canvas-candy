# Canvas Candy for Obsidian

Canvas Candy is a product I released for Obsidian that visually extends the canvas functionality. I have decided to open-source the product so that the community can continue to extend it.

# Why open-source Canvas Candy? 
As canvas functionality has become more popular in the Obsidian community, many new solutions and plugins have become available. 

Therefore, instead of this being a commercial product, it would be better suited to complement the growing collection of community solutions and thus help Canvas Candy continue to be more helpful. 

Canvas Candy has one unique benefit over some of the other solutions. Since it only uses a CSS snippet, it is not dependent on JavaScript or other plugins. Many users prefer not to use plugins or minimize their use, and Canvas Candy helps make that possible. 

# Community Content
