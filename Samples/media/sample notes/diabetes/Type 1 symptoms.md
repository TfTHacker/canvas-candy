It can develop quickly and include increased thirst and frequent urination, extreme hunger, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, irritability or unusual behavior, blurred vision, and in females, a yeast infection.

It's vital to consult a healthcare professional if these symptoms are present, as untreated Type 1 diabetes can lead to serious health complications.
