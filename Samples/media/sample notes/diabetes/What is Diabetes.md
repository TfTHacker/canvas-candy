Diabetes is a chronic health condition where the body's ability to produce or respond to insulin is impaired, resulting in abnormal metabolism of carbohydrates and elevated levels of glucose in the blood. It's categorized mainly into Type 1, where the body doesn't produce insulin, and Type 2, where the body doesn't effectively use insulin. If not properly managed, both types can lead to complications like heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and vision problems.
